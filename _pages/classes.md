Both our online and in-person classes are founded in the teaching style of Mestre João Grande who developed a simple, efficient and yet challengingly nuanced approach to sharing traditional information in a fun and supportive class environment. Under Contramestre Deni’s leadership, our classes are structured generally as follows: 
Introduction and Warm-Up
Capoeira Angola Sequences (Can be trained alone or in partners)
Capoeira Anogla Music (no instruments required for beginners)
Bate-Papo (A non-formal conversation with question and answer)

The Capoeira Angola Center - Illinois follows the tradition which Mestre João Grande has established and we ask that you come to class with pants, flat soled shoes, and a t-shirt which can be tucked in. Belts are optional for beginners. 

Our classes are designed with accessibility in mind, meaning that you will be shown the movement or sequence that we will be training several times with an emphasis on adapting the movement to work for your body, fitness level and physical ability. Contramestre Deni emphasizes this in every class as the goal of Capoeira Angola is movement for life.
